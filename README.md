📩 SMS Spam Classification

A Machine Learning project to classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.# SMS-Spam-Classification
Machine learning model to classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (not spam).

📊 Project Overview

Built and evaluated ML models to detect SMS spam messages.
Applied text preprocessing techniques (tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming/lemmatization).

Converted text into numerical features using Bag of Words and TF-IDF Vectorization.
Trained and compared models such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM.
Achieved high accuracy in detecting spam messages effectively.

📂 Dataset

Publicly available SMS Spam Collection Dataset.
Contains 5,574 messages labeled as ham (legit) or spam.
